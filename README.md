# SQL Student Database - VBA 
This project was developed using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). It utilizes SQL requests to retrieve data from a database containing student names and grades for various assignments and classes. The user is able to select a specific assignment and class, and the program will generate a graph displaying the grades of the students in that class for the chosen assignment.

Upon launching the program, the user is presented with a menu allowing them to select the desired assignment and class. Upon making their selection and clicking a button to retrieve the data, the program will execute an SQL query to fetch the relevant data from the database. The program will then process this data and use it to generate a graph, which is displayed to the user in a graphical user interface (GUI).
